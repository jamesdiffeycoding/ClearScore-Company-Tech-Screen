# 14th December 2024 ----

I faced a challenge: 205 vulnerabilities in the packages being installed.
I assumed this was because the project was old and the packages installed are either no longer maintained or have newer versions.
I ran npm audit fix, and it dropped to 159 vulnerabilities
I left this issue unsolved.
